# Slack Location Command

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/v-ges/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/v-slack-location/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/v-slack-location/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

`Slack Location` is a tool to quickly view Slack team members sorted by location (depending on their status icon, text or timezone).

It is an example of a Serverless Slack Command Integration using AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway.

## The example flow

- The Slack client (`/location` command) is [sending a POST](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands#how_do_commands_work).
- The API Gateway is transforming the Form body into JSON (see Velocity script `aws-template-api-gateway` in the tree below).
- The Lambda is taking the hand and calling the Slack API for fetching the Slack team members information (via OAuth).
- Slack is returing the information post-filtered by the Lambda which is returning a [proper JSON response](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands#responding_to_a_command) for the Slack client.

Here is [the article](https://medium.com/@vladimir.pasquier/how-to-aws-lambda-and-slack-app-dea65d13b867) with more visuals.

## Getting Started with Slack Location

Slack App creation:

- Go to your Slack team and create a custom App
- Add a custom command and activate the OAuth installing the App to your team
- In the custom command window give the API Gateway link
- Take the token in the App description and put it in `config.json`
- Take the OAuth token in the App management and put it in `config.json`

API Lambda:

You can create directly the lambda via the console or using the shell scripts inside of this repository (check the package.json for all `npm` commands).

- Create your lambda and associate it with the default IAM role
- Enable CloudWatch

API Gateway:

- Create an API Gateway in POST
- Add a custom Velocity template (`aws-template-api-gateway` in this repository) to the integration request
- Enable CloudWatch

Dev:

- Deploy your lambda to test (`npm run deploy`) and test it with a simple CURL to check if everything is well received
- Use `npm test` of course
- If you have any issue with Slack client, don't hesitate [this issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45739710/custom-slack-command-with-aws-api-gateway-500-service-error) I was facing

NB: You have 1M calls for free with AWS Lambda
